# ICML2020-Papers-Information

## This repository does NOT contain PDFs of ICML papers. This repository contains csv files of all titles and authors (ONLY) of ICML papers. To have access to papers, you will have to have login credentials to the conference itself.

This repository has three important files:
1. **ICML2020_papers_authors_ID.csv**: CSV files of all papers in ICML2020 with authors of each paper listed.
2. **ICML2020_authors_all.csv**: CSV files of all authors that can be found on Google Scholars with their affiliations.
3. **ICML2020-Papers-Information.ipynb**: Jupyter notebook for the process of obtaining all the information on ICML 2020 papers and authors.


## Disclaimer
None of the papers are my work, I simply have created CSV files that list all the papers by authors and searched all the authors on Google Scholars so that beginners like me are not overwhelmed by the sheer amount of research papers.
